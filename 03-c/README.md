# Day 3: C

## Previous Experiences

I've done a few small things with C already, including a small-ish university project.

## Notes

C is really the pain that I remember it to be.

The problem is that a lot of utility data types that one is used to, have to be created and managed manually with the corresponding memory stuff.

This was a wild ride to get finished.

Also just quickly glancing over the CMake file gives me bad flashbacks again.
