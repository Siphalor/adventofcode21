# Day 14: Java

## Previous Experiences

I've done a lot of stuff, mostly Minecraft modding, with Java.
So I don't really expect any surprises.

## Notes

After Groovy, Java feels good again.
It is indeed pretty verbose but feels a lot more concise than Groovy.

## The Task

I just want to say I really liked today's task.
It really tricked you into a naive approach first and then punched you on the nose for the second part.
I love the fact that it let you run into a memory space problem ^^
