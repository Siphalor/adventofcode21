# Day 2: Haskell

## Previous Experiences

I have worked with Haskell's shell (`ghci`) for some small university projects but never used it for a standalone program.

## Notes

I really like Haskell's pattern matching but the monad stuff and tagged return types (e.g. `IO`) just feel weird.

IntelliJ's Haskell plugin was a bit annoying to get working.
