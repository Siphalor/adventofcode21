# Day 8: V

## Previous Experiences

I had no previous experiences with V but have done a university project with Go.

## Notes

V really feels a lot like Go with a tad of Rust sprinkled in.

Although compiler failures can be a lot less helpful (because of the translation to C), the language feels overall more mature and likable than Go.

I'm definitely gonna revisit V.

Just a note about todays task: I felt like it was considerably harder than the others until now. It might've also been caused by the fact that I missed a few things during my implementation and failed a couple of times.
