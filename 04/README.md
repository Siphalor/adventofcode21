# Day 4: Python

## Previous Experiences

I've done a bunch of things with python in the past, reaching from scripts over small games or university stuff.

In most recent times I mostly worked with numpy/scipy stuff though.

## Notes

Python is really convenient which is also why I chose this for today where I don't have much time.

It's really great for hacking stuff together but then there are these small pain points, like not having a sane list `find` function or similar issues.
