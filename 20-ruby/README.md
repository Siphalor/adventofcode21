# Day 20: Ruby

## Previous Experiences

None.

## Notes

I saw some Ruby code in the good ol' CodingGame, and it tended to win the prizes for shortest code.

I know really understand why.

Ruby has *a ton* of built-in functions and literally every functionality has multiple slightly varying ways of writing it.
You really feel at home fast with Ruby, but I'm still not sure if that's a language that I'd want to work with for a larger project.

Ruby's code can be extremely obscure since there are a lot of functions that have some oddly specific parameters.
I'm especially thinking of `string.unpack(flags)` which has a large amount of flags to specify how to parse a string into something else.
These flags are one-letter codes and the resulting code is really hard to understand.
