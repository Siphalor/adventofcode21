# Day 12: C++

## Previous Experiences

C++ was one of the first programming languages I learned but after a few years of doing some small I stuff with it, I left and didn't return.

## Notes

It really took some time getting used to it and in the beginning I found myself writing C code quite often.
I needed some serious dedication to actually write some C++ things and I quickly realized why I chose to leave C++ development.

C++ is extremely verbose and the header/source file stuff is just extremely annoying.
When you know what you do (which I do a bit), memory management is less annoying than in Rust but you really have to keep track of your stuff then.

I don't really want to do a lot with C++ anymore.
It's just really annoying to work with and feels just like C but with a few addons slapped on top of it.
