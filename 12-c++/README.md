# Day 11: Julia

## Previous Experiences

I have no experience with Julia.

## Notes

Julia feels like Python but more verbose in some pain points of python (blocks must be `end`ed explicitly).
There's also a lot of stuff targeting data science such as builtin matrices.

Performance wise Julia is said to be pretty good, but I couldn't really test it with the task.

It's not a language I particularly love or hate - it might be useful when I need to some data science stuff again, so I have an alternative to the pain that Python environments often are.
