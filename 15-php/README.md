# Day 15: PHP

## Previous Experiences

I've done a lot of web development with PHP in the past, so I feel pretty comfortable working with it.

## Notes

PHP has it's quirks, but it's really not a bad language.
Honestly, the whole array processing/lambda/reference stuff is way easier and more intuitive than I remember.

I still wouldn't use PHP for larger projects anymore, but for web-related scripts it's pretty much unbeatable in my opinion.
