# Day 7: Perl

## Previous Experiences

I had no previous experiences with Perl but I'm pretty familiar with PHP and Python.

## Notes

Perl is ... weird. It really feels like a weird combination between mostly PHP and a bit of Python.

Some tasks can be formulated extremely short, but the syntax is often extremely obscure. E.g. reading from a file handle `FH`:

```perl
my $line = <FH>;
```
