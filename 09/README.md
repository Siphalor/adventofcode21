# Day 9: Lua

## Previous Experiences

I did some minor things a long time ago with Lua but didn't really like it. Hence, I didn't use it anymore and basically didn't know anything about it anymore.

## Notes

Lua feels like a trimmed down version of python and is a bit annoying to work with.
A lot of the convenience functions one is used to don't really exist in Lua and must be created manually.

Today's challenge was pretty doable though, so it didn't have too much of an impact on my performance ;)
