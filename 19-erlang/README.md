# Day 19: Erlang

## Previous Experiences

None.

## Notes

Erlang feels a lot like a less modern version of Haskell.
A lot of the syntax is similar or even the same.

I do like that Erlang uses parenthesis, but I still prefer Haskell.
Haskell just feels like a more mature language, even if it's newer.
