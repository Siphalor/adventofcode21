# Day 16: JavaScript

## Previous Experiences

In the beginning, when still pretty new to coding, I learned JavaScript and learned to like it as a client-side scripting language in browsers.
I really enjoyed its simplicity in contrast to the other language I used at the time, C++ ^^.

Later, I had to use CoffeeScript in a project with server-side JavaScript and that pretty much ruined server-side JavaScript for me.

All the simplicity I liked JavaScript for was gone, and each and every site had like three or four different files that defined the look, structure and logic for it.
Also, CoffeeScript had to be compiled to JavaScript, which lead to some weird things with that transition.

Recently, I had to work with TypeScript/Angular for my current company and at least partially accepted that server-side JavaScript *might* be ok.

## Notes

Working with pure Node JavaScript, I actually learned a few things about ECMAScript 6, that I never really cared about (like modules and classes).

On the other side, I also learned that ES6 doesn't have type annotations, which quickly annoyed me, coming from type-safe languages.

Working with it was still kind of fun, but I think I'm going to try out TypeScript next time.

But I have to say that I very much prefer other server-side languages at this point in time.
