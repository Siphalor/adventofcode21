# Day 17: Clojure

## Previous Experiences

None.
But I looked over the docs of the [Nanopass framework](https://nanopass.org) which uses Scheme (another Lisp dialect).
I had trouble understanding the Listing though.

## Notes

Clojure (a dialect of Lisp) really has some interesting concepts.
Not only does the parenthesized prefix syntax of Lisp feel pretty unfamiliar but also *everything* being an expression is a pretty neat concept.

Nevertheless, I found working with it kinda unnerving.
This was caused by myself mixing up function names from the tutorial and using `vector` where a `constantly` would have been appropriate.
This caused **extremely** unhelpful error messages where you could only guess what's happening in that line.

I'd really like to explore the [Nanopass framework](https://nanopass.org) for some project though.
It's based on Scheme, not Clojure, but both languages should be pretty similar.
If you're reading this and are by chance interested in compilers, then you might want to check that out.
It has some pretty cool concepts of how to build modern compilers.
For a video with one of it's inventor's talking about it, [check this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os7FE3J-U5Q).
