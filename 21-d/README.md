# Day 21: D

## Previous Experiences

None. C++/C though.

## Notes

D feels a lot like a less verbose version of C++.

It feel like anything *huge* changed, but there are definitely a lot of small changes and a lot of syntactic sugar.

There's also a garbage collector (that can be turned off, apparently) and some other language features, that really ease development.

I also appreciate that D has a module system which really means a lot, coming from C++.

If I'd have to use C/C++ for some special big-ish project D might be interesting, but I think I'd usually choose other languages like Rust or V instead.
