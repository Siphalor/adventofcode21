# Day 13: Groovy

## Previous Experiences

I am pretty used to writing Gradle build scripts in Groovy.
Therefore, I know some basic stuff, but I never used Groovy for anything else.

## Notes

Groovy is as clunky as I feared.
It really feels like somebody saw Java and though "variables and lambdas are too verbose" and then just threw some of that stuff out.
It's usually just a thin wrapper around Java and not even good at it.

I really prefer Kotlin over Groovy, although I respect the use of Groovy in Gradle build scripts.
Groovy is ok-ish as a scripting language - it's just bad as a programming language :P
